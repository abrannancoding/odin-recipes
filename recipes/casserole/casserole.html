        Chicken melds with lots of flavors like bacon, ranch, 
        and Colby Jack to make a yummy feast for the whole family.</p>
        <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
        <h3"><em>What you need</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container fat-free sour cream</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix 
                (such as Lipton® Recipe Secrets®)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>2 green onions, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to
                 a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet 
                 firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
                 turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon
                  slices on paper towels. Crumble.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot skillet, 
                sprinkle with lemon-pepper, and brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove with 
                a slotted spoon and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 of the crumbled bacon, sour cream, soup, milk, and ranch dressing mix 
                in a bowl and mix until blended. Pour over chicken, add drained egg noodles, and stir. 
                Sprinkle remaining bacon on top, cover with Colby-Jack cheese, and top with green onions.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 
                about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
