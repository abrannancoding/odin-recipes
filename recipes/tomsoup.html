    <p>One spoonful of tomato soup has the power to automatically transport 
        you back to your childhood. The tasty soup is the ultimate comfort food, 
        especially when it's homemade.</p>
    <h2><em>The Process</em></h2>
    <h3>What you need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion </li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, <em>or to taste</em></li>
    
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes,
             onion, cloves and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and
              gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors.
               Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a 
               large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. 
            Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown.
             Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. 
             Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
